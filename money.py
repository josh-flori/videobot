# which is 3.2million a month, which at CB's monetization rate is $4,800 a month, or $57,600 a year. And the views on this channel are small compared to the same guy's other reddit channel, which is getting, i didn't count, but probably 10mill+ a month. The revenue potential here is conversatively 50k, up to 100k a year, I think, IF the channel can get traction, which I think it should. It's a hot topic right now. And no one but this guy seems to be doing content at scale.
