Got connection to reddit/google back up and running
Images pulling from reddit fine
Began writing text cleaning algo, includes 1 simple regex
Wrote function to get size of text boxes relative to entire image as an attempt to remove any extra small text, but
somehow the results on the first image were not useful regardless of whether i considered area of bounding boxes or height
only. I think I should give up on that... a better approach would be with each video to export list of timestamps on each
section and allow user to re-run removing any objectionable timestamped sections.

I feel the images are cleaner this time anyway.

I've reviewed a number of text outputs and they look g2g with 0 processing. Tomorrow I will work on getting audio and
bounding boxes/rectangles.
I've thought about it and I think training a network to recognize where to put the bounding boxes would be good. There
are enough general cases I think it should be ok enough of the time. Try this first:
https://blog.insightdatascience.com/how-to-train-your-own-yolov3-detector-from-scratch-224d10e55de2

frames to potentially remove: 119,129,13,133,145,18,184
161 wouldn't load

I'm changing my thoughts.. i feel it would be better to just use the bounding boxes from the text recognition to block
out the text. you need to implement a lot of logic but i think it will work better. then just use the network for
recognizing frames although to be honest you may be able to do it without the network... idk about that right now.


I tested using paragraph blocks to create text and it looks promising enough. Moving onto masking out sections of the
paragraph if ':' contained within.

it's working reasonably well... need to figure out:
how to clean text in this format
how to force proper text order
if i need to uncover text at all in certain panel types... maybe in 4 panel types just ignore text blocks entirely...
    maybe you could just have the network recognize 4 panels and then split it evenly into 4 quadrants

im trying to think of how to remove bad text... the actual text IS included as a single object...
if i could convert this to something iterable it might be easier?

ok figured that shit out fast enough...

NEXT UP! break up any multi-line paragraph into individual blocks

###############
#     4/24    #
###############
trying to break up multi-lines... i think you could just count the number of '/n's.... and then just divide the
height of the paragraph by that number and create that many blocks, assuming they are all the same height of course....

DONE.

used google automl to create a pretty decent network. time to start writing code for it!

so how would we solve this problem? lets map out some if statements....
if annotation_count==1 & cleanified(x,x)==[0,1] & cleanified(y)>.05
well... in order to reveal any frame you HAVE to know it's relationship to the text
you could have a like, "which_comes_next()" function which just has access to all the bounding boxes for text and frames
and then just is like, well, which type comes next? and then that would be like the master function creating all the boxes...

I made a successful function for creating boxes/frames/text whatever at least for image 0! moving on to the next...


ok debugged some shitty code... next step would be to write function to trim boxes down to the intersection of mostly
white and mostly non-white pixels like in the case of image 4.jpg.

welp, I guess pretty much have a good thing going here :D works pretty damn well
You know what to do from here... just wrap it up and make sure nothing weird pops up. :D

need to work on getting aws config figured out to run audio.. then run audio...
yadayada... too tired to continue... but still happy with my progress.

have ffmpeg figured out. was trying to figure out how to line the audio up with image panels.
figured out solution. mostly wrote solution, need to finish writing and test it out tomorrow.

have it mostly figured out the only problem is.. all_boxes are not sorted correctly.
i need to figure out some way to properly sort it....
you could be like "on the basis of the existence of frames, for each frame that exists vertically, is there any text
...." well shit i guess you could just write a modified version of the watchamacallit function... ya i guess that would
work

im sick off deploying the model, here is link for edge https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51867204/can-googles-automl-export-trained-models-for-offline-inference

got sorting working... everything looks useable... lets move onto creating the videos

or jsut deploy model like

https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/docs/deploy

how do we do this video thing?
as we perform the initial image creation loop, we need to pass out some indication of the duration of each
image... i guess that would be based on the length of the audio... so you could either pass it out or jsut read it off
the audio itself.

so im discovering that the function that creates box_text_type doesn't follow the same logic as teh function
that writes the images... bOTH are based on boxes but write_images ignores some boxes. that ignore logic needs to
be abstracted and passed to both functions so if they logic updates, both are updated.

then, you need to offset your waiting times so that the first frame is uncovered almost immediately and the duration of the
NEXT frame is equal to the length of that frame... ok i guess this is fine.

-- coming back to this, i was thinking while doing dishes, why didn't i just read the len of the audio? that really is
the best way to go! OH FUCK NOW I'M REMEMBERING WHY I DIDN'T DO THAT!!! THERE AREN'T AS MANY FUCKING MP3S as there are
images god damnit
ok we can't use the same logic because that logic fucking removes text and the very thing we're trying to do is account
for text. HMMMM
as i think about it...
so the problem really arises when the number of paragraphs INSIDE a frame is greater than 1.
ok my brain is really starting to break down on everything that is fucking happening here...

i feel there should be a more gauranteed way to link to images...
like...as you write the images... get information about what text is within those particular text boxes...
shouldn't be that hard???
ya i think you can pass the paragraph text into the boxes.. and then do something with that

-------
9:18pm... got the video working... fuck that was kind of hard actually. i NEED to restructure and comment the shit
out of this

working on tweaking the parameters so the video length is just about right.
im noticing that there needs to be a minimum length in the case where text is within a frame and it's small text where
the resulting duration would be less than the standard waiting time for a frame.

it just feels so inelegant to base this off approximations. i should do it on the audio itself.

11:20 confirmed that at a small enough resolution, the duration set in movie writer is indeed in seconds, whereas
the audio len is measured in milliseconds

fuckk yaaaa i did it. time to comment the shit out of this shit

lotsssss of problems that need to be fixed still....
big one right at this exact moment is...
so i have the case of a bad model! creating this boxes...
[(0, 420), (582, 801), (255, 255, 255)]
[(0, 400), (508, 426), (255, 255, 255)]
which overlap and are just not good.... we need to clean that shit up...

ok i suppose i solved that... still have shit issues... like google thinking things are paragraphs that fucking arent...

you could define a paragraph as any text box that comes the same distance below the previous text box as the one before
it as well as being within the same horizontal plane
